# Localization or Internationalization

Localization is the process of translating an appâ€™s user interface and resources into different languages.

## There are two ways to possible :
    - Using interfacebuilder (Storyboard)
    - Using ViewController (Localizable.strings file)

Application name changing using InfoPlist.strings file. 

## Dynamic content, pluralization and Internationalizing
	- Dynamic content changes
        For example : 
            I have 10 pens.  (Here 10 is number how we can change programmatically)
	- Pluralization  (Localizable.stringsdict)
        For example :
            I have 1 pen. => Singular form 
            I have 10 pens. => Plural form
	- Internationalizing Numbers
        Currency changes based on country
